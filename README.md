# dotfiles

Dotfiles are configuration files that typically start with a `.` (dot) for
Unix-type systems such as: MacOS, Linux, BSD, Docker containers,
[Windows/WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about),
Windows Unix-emulators such as
[cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) or GitBash.

Since dotfiles start with a `.`, they are sometimes hidden and not shown.
Make sure to enable showing hidden files on your system.

Dotfiles define settings of the environment (e.g.
[environment variables](https://opensource.com/article/19/8/what-are-environment-variables)
such as *PATH* to find commands or *CLASSPATH* to run Java programs).
They apply to specific applications, services and tools.


&nbsp;

Dotfiles are grouped into:

 - *system-wide* files that apply to the system/machine and all users.
    They are stored in folders associated with the system or application
    installations.

    For example: the system-wide (global)
    [*settings.json*]()
    file for the *VS Code* IDE resides in "C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Code\User"
    on Windows.

 - *user* dotfiles apply to a user account and reside in the user's HOME-directory.

    Examples of dotfiles in the HOME directory are:

    - [*.profile*]():
        with commands executed when a new terminal is opened.
    
    - [*.bashrc*]():
        with commands when a new *bash* shell starts (command interpreter),
        e.g. when a new terminal is opened or *bash* command is invoked.

    - [*.zshrc*]():
        with commands when *zsh* shell starts (command interpreter for MacOS).

    - [*.gitconfig*]():
        with user settings for *git*.

    - [*.vimrc*]():
        settings for the *vi* editor.

    - [*.ssh*]():
        directory with PKI keys (e.g. `id_rsa.pub` and `id_rsa` public, private
        keys pairs).

 - *project* dotfiles reside in a project directory and are associated with the
    project.

    Examples of *project* dotfiles are:

    - [*.vscode*]():
        directory with configuration files for the *VS Code* IDE.

    - [*.project*](), [*.classpath*]():
        project configurations for *eclipse* and *VS Code* IDE.

    - [*.git/config*]():
        project *git* settings
